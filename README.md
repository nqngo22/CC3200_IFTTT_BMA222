# CC3200_IFTTT_BMA222

This application allows the user to send the CC3200's onboard BMA222 acceleration data to mobile devices with BoxCar2 <br />
installed. Whenever the users press the switch sw2 or sw3, the acceleration data of the BMA222 will be enclosed in a <br />
RESTful POST method and will be sent to IFTTT(If This Then That) where an event will be triggered. The service will <br />
then forward the BMA222 data to the mobile devices with BoxCar2 installed and registered with IFTTT. <br />
